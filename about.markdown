My name is Josh Chavez, I am a Senior Software Developer at <a href="https://bluefireinteractive.com/">Bluefire Interactive</a>. I like to think that I am a top notch developer, and I have a proven track record of being able to solve any problems my clients need. 

I excel at .Net, SQL Sever, MySql, Javascript/Jquery, HTML/CSS, Jekyll, Python, PHP, Wordpress, C, Java, and a bunch of other assorted technologies and languages. If its not listed here, I can figure it out! Unless it is Assembly. I took 2 Assembly classes previously, never fully understood it, and absolutely hated it. 

I graduated in 2016 from Eastern Washington University with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science and have been working as a Software Developer ever since I graduated. 

If you want me to do some coding work for you, reach out to me at <a href="mailto:josh@bluefireinteractive.com">josh@bluefireinteractive.com</a> and we can figure out a solution to your problem! If you want me to do some design work for you, you are completely misunderstanding my proficiencies - but at Bluefire we work with lots of incredible designers and I'm sure we can solve whatever problem you need!

For all other stuff, reach out to me at <a href="mailto:joshthorchavez@gmail.com">my personal email</a> and if it is at all interesting I will respond!

Love,
Josh
